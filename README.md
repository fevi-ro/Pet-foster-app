This is our second project during the Ironhack Web development bootcamp

A web-app which aims to help pet resquing and fostering teams keep track of the animals available for adoption.
Pet fostering communities and volunteers provide temporary care to shelter or stray animals who need to live in a home environment prior to adoption. The user will be able to see a list of the animals available for adoption, details for every animal, location etc. Fostering team members will additionally be able to update/edit pet profiles, create a new one and delete it as soon as an animal finds a forever home.
